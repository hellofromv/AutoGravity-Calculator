# AutoGravity Calculator

## Description
This is a coding challenge I completed for AutoGravity that required me to utilize React with Redux.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies
In the root directory of your command line, run:
```
npm install
```

### How to Open Application
From the same directory, run:
```
npm start
```
This should automatically open a page in your browser to view the application at localhost:3000
